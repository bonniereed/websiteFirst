        <p>I work in a tech support role and many of the users I support
            are developers. I am familiar with troubleshooting and looking for answers.
            I think that my current abilities to work through hard issues can be applied
            in debugging code. 
        </p>
        <div class = "snippet">I'm really excited to see all of the potential 
            in how much can be done with web development.

        <div id = "early">I started my adult life as a hairdresser and have always
            had a creative eye. I squealed a little bit when I was going over color 
            theory with freecodecamp in preparation for this precoursework. The possibilites
            are endless.
        </div>
        <div>I can't wait to get started!
        </div>
        <p>When I'm not working I enjoy listening, dancing to, and creating music.
